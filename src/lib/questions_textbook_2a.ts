        question: "Why is the heating element of an electric kettle usually placed at the bottom?",
        answer: "To set up a convection current. As the water at the bottom is heated, it expands and becomes less dense, rising. Cooler water from the top sinks to the bottom to be heated, ensuring all the water is eventually heated.",
        explanation: "Keywords: Convection, density, circulation.",
        difficulty: "Standard"

        question: "Explain the role of insulation in reducing heat transfer.",
        answer: "Insulators are poor conductors of heat (they have trapped air pockets). They reduce heat loss by conduction and convection by trapping air which is a poor conductor.",

        question: "How does wearing black clothing affect body temperature on a sunny day compared to white clothing?",
        answer: "Black clothing is a better absorber of radiant heat from the sun than white clothing. Therefore, wearing black will likely increase the body temperature more.",

        question: "What is 'Energy Efficiency'?",
        answer: "Energy efficiency is the ratio of useful energy output to the total energy input, often expressed as a percentage.",
